        <p>I was out for my usual morning run and found myself stumbling through the late-summer heat, wishing I had taken a water bottle. </p>
        <p> I stopped under a bridge for a moment of shade, I saw two young, scruffy men standing next to their sleeping bags. One smiled and gently raised his hand as if motioning “hello” but didn’t say a word. He wasn’t asking for anything. I smiled and made the same motion back to him.</p>
        <p>We all benefit from connection. That homeless man impacted my day. After encountering him, I felt more grateful — appreciating all that I have. He triggered my compassion — I found myself feeling empathy for him. I had the choice to move towards separation or connection. Were there many ways in which he and I are very different? Absolutely! Are there many ways in which we are alike! Absolutely! I can reflect on times in my life that like him, I was in a situation I had never anticipated, times that I felt broke, times that I felt at a low point. And as he may have been feeling this morning, times when I needed someone to stop and acknowledge me.We always have a choice as to whether we move towards separation or connection. Separation is looking at the homeless person and focusing on how unkempt he looks, and criticizing why he has a 7-11 Slurpee cup if he is out of money. Connection is acknowledging that he impacted my day by reaching out to me.We all benefit from connection. We always have a choice as to whether we move towards separation or connection.
